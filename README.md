> This Project is Still in Active Development!

This project leverages the power of Generative AI to enhance emergency management and decision-making processes. By utilizing advanced machine learning models, web scraping, and real-time data processing, the system is designed to provide comprehensive reports and insights during critical emergency situations. The core features of the project include:

- **Real-Time Alerts**: Fetches and stores up-to-date alerts from multiple news sources, categorizing them by location, topic, and severity.
- **Data-Driven Analysis**: Provides in-depth analysis and visualizations (charts, graphs) based on stored historical alerts, allowing users to assess trends, predict future events, and identify key hotspots and issues.
- **Report Generation**: Automatically generates and stores detailed reports on various emergency situations, facilitating informed decision-making for disaster management teams.
- **Keyword & Topic Analysis**: Analyzes popular keywords and trends across different regions, helping identify emerging issues in real-time.
- **User-Controlled Insights**: Enables users to customize reports and visualizations based on date, time range, and region, empowering tailored response strategies.

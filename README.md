## Project Overview

The **EMSUGI** is a sophisticated application designed to gather and analyze emergency alerts from various sources. It leverages generative AI to predict future incidents based on historical data and current trends. This system aims to enhance the efficiency of emergency responses by providing insightful reports and visual analytics.

> This Project is Still in Active Development!

## Key Features:
- **Real-Time Alert Monitoring**: Fetches and stores emergency alerts across different countries.
- **Generative AI**: Implements AI to analyze and generate future predictions of emergency incidents.
- **Graphical Representation**: Displays data using charts and graphs, allowing users to visualize key metrics.
- **Interactive Date/Time Range Selection**: Enables users to set custom date and time ranges for report generation.
- **Keyword and Topic Analysis**: Identifies popular keywords and topics by country and region.
- **Responsive Design**: Supports a mobile-friendly and responsive layout for viewing reports.


> **NOTE:** These features are based project's future intention so the actual performance and feature may vary due to active development phases

            <h2 class="section-header">Project Overview</h2>
            <p class="section-content">
                The EMSUGI project is an advanced emergency management system that uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to predict and analyze emergency incidents. By collecting real-time data from various sources such as articles, reports, and case studies, EMSUGI aims to assist in emergency response planning and preparedness. However, the project's predictions and alerts are based on historical and real-time data and should be used with caution.
            </p>

            <h2 class="section-header">Research and Development Purpose Only</h2>
            <p class="section-content">
                The EMSUGI project is being developed for <span class="highlight">research and development purposes only</span>. The insights and predictions generated by the system are based on data retrieved from publicly available sources. While EMSUGI aims to provide useful information for emergency management, the data it generates may not reflect real-world conditions accurately.
            </p>

            <h2 class="section-header">Prediction Limitations</h2>
            <p class="section-content">
                The <span class="highlight">predictions</span> made by EMSUGI are based on real-time data fetching from various news articles, reports, and case studies. While these predictions may offer insight into potential emergency incidents, they do not guarantee real-world outcomes. The prediction models are built on historical trends and may not account for unforeseen variables that could impact emergency situations.
            </p>
            <p class="section-content">
                It is essential to understand that the predictions provided by EMSUGI should not be relied upon for critical decisions or emergency planning. The data generated might not reflect actual future events and should only be used for informational purposes or academic research.
            </p>

            <h2 class="section-header">How It Works</h2>
            <p class="section-content">
                EMSUGI collects data from various real-time sources, including:
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-6">
                <li class="section-content">News articles related to emergencies and disasters.</li>
                <li class="section-content">Reports and statistics from government and emergency response organizations.</li>
                <li class="section-content">Historical case studies of past emergency incidents.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="section-content">
                This data is then processed by generative AI models that analyze trends and predict potential future incidents. The system generates reports and predictions based on this analysis, providing users with insights into possible emergency events that may occur in the future.
            </p>

            <h2 class="section-header">Disclaimer of Accuracy</h2>
            <p class="section-content">
                EMSUGI makes no claims regarding the accuracy, reliability, or safety of the predictions and insights generated by the system. The data and predictions should be treated as exploratory and not as definitive conclusions or recommendations for emergency planning.
            </p>
            <p class="section-content">
                Users should independently verify all predictions and reports before making any critical decisions based on them. The creators of this system do not assume any responsibility for the outcomes of actions taken based on the generated data.
            </p>

            <h2 class="section-header">Intended Use</h2>
            <p class="section-content">
                EMSUGI is intended to serve as a tool for research, data analysis, and educational purposes. It is not designed for direct application in real-time emergency response or decision-making. The system may provide valuable insights for improving emergency management strategies, but users should not rely on it as a sole resource for critical operations.
            </p>

            <h2 class="section-header">Future Enhancements</h2>
            <p class="section-content">
                The EMSUGI system is still under active development, and future versions of the platform will include enhancements in prediction accuracy, data integration, and usability. The development team is continuously working to improve the models and expand the dataset to provide more valuable insights.
            </p>
            <p class="section-content">
                As this project evolves, new features may be added, and the current capabilities may be adjusted or refined. Users are encouraged to follow updates and participate in providing feedback to help improve the platform.
